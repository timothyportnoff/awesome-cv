Hello! I'm Tim, passionate software dev with with 15+ years of experience specializing in software, architecture, mechanics, design, and more. I'm looking forward to contribute to something great. I enjoy helping people and solving problems and see myself working in IT because I love sharing what I know.

Absolutely LOVE Vim, even in my terminal and in VScode. I love open source projects and love participating in community forums and discussions to better myself and others for the pursuit of knowledge. Comfortable with daily drivers Windows and Linux, but okay with macOS. Super nerd that loves Vim mode and my custom dotfiles so I  can develop fast and efficiantly. Always making sure my setup is customized  to find the most optimal environment. Interested in devising a better problem-solving method for challenging tasks, and learning new technologies and tools.

I'm looking forward to apply my skills and expertise to a challenging and dynamic role, ideally in IT support or software development, where I can continue to grow and make a meaningful impact in the world of tech.
